INEC Nigeria Web Scraper


This project is a web scraping tool designed to extract data from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) website in Nigeria. 
The goal of this project is to efficiently gather election-related information using a combination of web scraping and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques.

Tools Used:
Selenium: For browser automation and navigating dynamic web content.
BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML content and extracting specific data from the webpage.
OCR: Optical Character Recognition converts images and PDFs (which may contain scanned polling unit results in tabular data) into readable text.


Features:
Dynamic Content Navigation: The scraper is designed to handle pages that use JavaScript or other dynamic content loaders, thanks to Selenium's browser automation capabilities.
Data Extraction: BeautifulSoup is employed to parse the HTML structure and extract relevant data, such as election results, voter statistics, or other public information available on the INEC website.
PDF & Image Handling: Since INEC often publishes documents in PDF format or as images, OCR is used to convert these files into text, making it easier to extract valuable information.



Extracted data will be stored in a structured format (CSV, JSON, or database) as per your configuration.
